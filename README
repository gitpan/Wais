For installation you need a installed perl5. I used perl5.002b1f.
Also you need the freeWAIS-sf-2.0 distribution with patchlevel >=
46. For compilation the source directory of freeWAIS-sf is used.  For
the tests the test database in the freeWAIS-sf source directoryis
used. So recreate it if you cleaned tehere.

Untar the waisperl tarfile outside the perl source tree.  Then, you
have to edit Makefile.PL and customize it with the name of your
freeWAIS-sf source directory. (Hopefully, you didn't blow the latter
away after compiling freeWAIS-sf. :))

Then run 'perl Makefile.PL'. For building a dynamic extension use 

        make; make test; make install

For building a perl with the wais extensions statically linked use

        make perl; make test_static;

See the documentation of MakeMaker for details. Run

        perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker
