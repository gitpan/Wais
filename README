For installation you need a installed perl5. I used perl5.001n and
perl5.002.  Also you need the freeWAIS-sf-2.0 distribution with
patchlevel >= 46. For compilation the source directory of freeWAIS-sf
is used.  For the tests the test database in the freeWAIS-sf source
directory is used. So recreate it if you cleaned there.

Untar the waisperl tarfile outside the perl source tree.  Then, you
have to edit Makefile.PL and customize it with the name of your
freeWAIS-sf source directory. 'perl Makefile.PL' will ask you for the
directory if you did not do that. (Hopefully, you didn't blow the
latter away after compiling freeWAIS-sf. :))

Then run 'perl Makefile.PL'. For building a dynamic extension use 

        make; make test; make install

For building a perl with the wais extensions statically linked use

        make perl; make test_static;

See the documentation of MakeMaker for details. Run

        perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker

chat2.pl:

        The standard chat2.pl does not work on SOLARIS. I have
        included a self-extracting chat2.pl which will serve a
        replacement for the distributions chat2.pl. It uses the socket
        module to set the parameters. On systems on which chat2.pl
        works, the replacement it will be some miliseconds faster ;-)

        5.002:
        You must remove the orignal chat2.pl since it will be in the
        include path before this chat2.pl after installation. 'make
        install' will ask you if it should be removed.  If you are
        paranoid, run diff on both versions. They are identical
        besides some socket constants. You can verify them in
        sockets.h if you want to.

        5.001
        Installation will overwrite chat2.pl anyway ;-)

        Trust me ;-)
