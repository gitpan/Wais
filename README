For installation you need a installed perl5. I used perl5.001m.  Also
you need the freeWAIS-sf-2.0 distribution with patchlevel >= 46. For
compilation the source directory of freeWAIS-sf is used.

Untar the waisperl tarfile outside the perl source tree.  Then, you have to
edit Makefile.PL and customize it with the name of your freeWAIS-sf
source directory. (Hopefully, you didn't blow the latter away after
compiling freeWAIS-sf. :)) 

Then run 'perl Makefile.PL'. For building a dynamic extension use 

        make; make install

For building a perl with the wais extensions statically linked use

        make perl
